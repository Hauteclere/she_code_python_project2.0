# She Codes Python Unit Project

Your first unit showed you how to write HTML and CSS code to create websites. 

In this unit, you have learned how to write programs using Python. Perhaps you've been wondering: when do we get to the Python WEBSITES?

Honestly, that's the next unit. In that unit we will use a Python library called Django Rest Framework to create a website back-end.

But in the meantime, there's no reason we can't choose a way to demonstrate out Python skills that exercises our existing HTML/CSS knowledge!

This project repo defines a class called an `HTMLWidget` that you can use to create snippets of HTML.
